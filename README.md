### Hi there

I am a runner, computer science PhD student, and StatBall enthusiast - but not necessarily in that order.

- 🧠 I’m currently working on deep reinforcement learning, autonomous vehicles, and neural networks
- 🐒 Exploring efficient and responisble reinforcement learning methods
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on deep reinforcement learning projects! If you have a cool environment and are looking for someone to implement DRL methods, let me know!
- 🤔 Would love to learn more about transformer architectures
- 💬 Ask me about my baseball obsession 
- 📫 How to reach me: elochang(at) u c s c . e d u
- 🏃🏻‍♂️ Fun fact: I ran a half-marathon in 1 hour and 7 minutes (5:11 min/mile)!
