### Hi there

I am a runner, computer science PhD student, and StatBall enthusiast - but not necessarily in that order.

- 🧠 I’m currently working on deep reinforcement learning, autonomous vehicles, and neural networks
- 🐒 I’m currently learning policy gradient and actor-critic methods
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on deep reinforcement learning projects! If you have a cool environment and are looking for someone to implement DRL methods, let me know!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with transformers
- 💬 Ask me about my research
- 📫 How to reach me: elochang(at) u c s c . e d u
- 🏃🏻‍♂️ Fun fact: I ran a half-marathon in 1 hour and 9 minutes (5:17 min/mile)!
